In this file, you will find 3 datasets used in the manuscript to run the multivariate analyses (PERMANOVA, DistLM, PCA, SIMPER) that were done in PRIMER software.
The datasets contain abundance data (percentage coverage) of taxa identified at different shore levels (mid-midlittoral, low-midlittoral, and infralittoral fringe) and environmental/anthropogenic variables.
