In this folder, you will find 3 datasets used in the manuscript to run the multivariate analyses (PERMANOVA, DistLM, PCA, SIMPER) that were done in PRIMER software. Each dataset contains abundance data (percentage coverage) of taxa identified at a specific shore level, either mid-midlittoral, low-midlittoral or infralittoral fringe, and the environmental/anthropogenic variables used as potential predictors.
The datasets are organised to be easily opened in PRIMER software.
